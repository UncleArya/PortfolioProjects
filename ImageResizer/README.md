# Image Resizer

A program with a basic and minimalistic GUI that quickly resizes images. Using Python, Tkinter, and the Pillow imaging library, you can quickly create a copy of an image with a smaller file size and resolution, downscaled based on requested dimensions or percentage calculation.

## Skills Used:

-   Python
    -   Pillow
    -   Tkinter
    -   Pathlib
-   UI/UX Design

## Instructions:

-   Copy-paste the path of the image you wish to resize into the File Path box
-   Select the option to either:
    -   Resize by provided dimensions
    -   Resize by desired percentage
-   Enter either a dimension value or a percentage value

**Note:** When the convert button is pressed, a copy of the original image will be resized and saved to the same location as the original image with `-resized` added to the file name.
