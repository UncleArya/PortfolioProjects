[Screencast from 2024-07-25 15-51-03.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e0c66ed-e0af-45a5-a527-816e09cbd05f)

## Skills Used:

-   Python
    -   Tkinter
    -   Custom class & functions
    -   Loops
    -   Complex calculations
-   UI/UX Design
-   Affinity Designer

## Instructions:

-   Place your cursor in the light grey box in the centre of the window
-   Once you click on the _Start_ button, a 60 second timer will begin
-   Hitting the _Space_ key submits your typed word and moves to the next word
-   You can hit _Reset_ to stop a typing session in process, or to clear results after a finished session

## Methodology:

-   Words per Minute (WPM) is calculated by the most commonly accepted metric of:
    -   Number of Words = (Characters Typed / 5)
    -   WPM = (Number of Words / 60)
-   A character includes punctuation
-   [Further details on common WPM calculation](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations)
