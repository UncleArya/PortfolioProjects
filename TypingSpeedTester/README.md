## Methodology:

-   Words per Minute (WPM) is calculated by the most commonly accepted metric of:
    -   Number of Words = (Characters Typed / 5)
    -   WPM = (Number of Words / 60)
-   A character includes punctuation
-   [Further details on common WPM calculation](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations)
