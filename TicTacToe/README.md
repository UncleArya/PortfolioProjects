# Tic Tac Toe

A basic game of tic-tac-toe that runs in the terminal. Includes single-player and multi-player modes. When playing single-player, the computer-player makes intelligent moves.

## Skills Used:

-   Python
    -   NPC algorithm
    -   Custom classes and functions
    -   Loops

## Instructions:

-   Once running the program, enter '1' to play a single-player game against a computer-player or enter '2' to play a multi-player game
-   For single-player games, the human-player is player 'X' and the computer is 'O'
-   The player who gets the first move is randomized each game
-   When you are prompted to enter your move, simply enter the coordinates for the square you wish to play (example: 'A1', 'B2', 'C3')
-   Feedback is given if an incorrect move is selected
-   The winner is the player who creates a line by row, column, or diagonal
-   The game is a draw if the board is full with no player creating a line
-   When the game is over, the player is prompted to replay or quit

## NPC Algorithm:

-   When it is the computer-player turn, the computer will attempt to make the most logical move in this order:
    -   If a win condition is present for the computer-player
    -   If a win condition is present for the human-player
    -   If both are false, a random move is made based on remaining spaces
